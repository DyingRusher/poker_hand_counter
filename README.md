# poker_hand_counter
I developed a real-time poker hand recognition system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. Trained on a dataset which consist 12,000 images and available online, it can identifie 10 poker hand types (straights, flushes, pairs, etc.) with a 94% accuracy rate. This project explores object detection for game analysis and offers potential for further development!


# working of project

1.run this commnd in terminal  "pip install ultralytics opencv-python cv2"  
2.run "detect_web_cam.py" python file

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:   
   `git clone https://github.com/DyingRusher/poker_hand_counter.git`  
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:  
   `cd poker_hand_detection`  
3. Install Dependencies:  
   `pip install ultralytics opencv-python`

# Usage  

First finish installation step

1. Run the Application:
   'python detect_web_cam.py`
2. Interact with the System:  
   For adding vanjan(consanant) hold that sign for 3 sec, and for adding matra(vowal) hold sign for 5 sec.For adding space do not detect any hand for 3 sec.

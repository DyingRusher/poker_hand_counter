# poker_hand_counter
I developed a real-time poker hand recognition system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. Trained on a dataset which consist 12,000 images and available online, it can identifie 10 poker hand types (straights, flushes, pairs, etc.) with a 94% accuracy rate. This project explores object detection for game analysis and offers potential for further development!
